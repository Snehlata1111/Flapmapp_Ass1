Mini Solar System Visualization - Task Summary
============================================

1. Render a simple solar system scene:
   - A static Sun is rendered at the center using a yellow circle.
   - Two planets orbit the Sun at different speeds and distances, animated using time-based transformations.
   - One planet has a moon that orbits it, also animated.

2. Implement custom shaders:
   - All shaders are written in GLSL and embedded in the code.
   - The Sun uses a custom fragment shader for a glow and pulsing effect based on time.
   - Planets and moon use a fragment shader with a radial gradient for simple visual variety.

3. Apply transformations:
   - Matrix transformations (scale, rotation, translation) are used for all objects.
   - Planets and moon orbit using translation, and rotate on their own axes using rotation matrices.

4. User interaction:
   - Camera controls allow rotating the view with mouse drag (left button).
   - Zoom in/out is supported with the mouse scroll wheel.
   - All transformations are applied via a view matrix.

5. Performance:
   - The application uses a single VAO and VBO for all circle geometry.
   - Rendering is efficient, with no per-frame geometry uploads.
   - The application runs smoothly and meets the 30 FPS or higher requirement.
